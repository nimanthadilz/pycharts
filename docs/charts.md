PyCharts++ supports the following hierarchical chart types.

More information about the supported chart types are provided below.

## Treemap

![Example Treemap](img/example_treemap.png)

Treemap represents a hierarchy using rectangles. Each rectangle corresponds to a node in the tree/hierarchy. The area of the rectangle is a representation of the value of the particular node associated with it. A treemap can be used to get an overall idea about the nodes and their values respective to the other nodes.
